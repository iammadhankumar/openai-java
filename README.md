# AI Integration with Spring Boot Application

This project demonstrates how to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into a Spring Boot application.

## Overview

In this project, we leverage AI technologies to enhance the functionality of a Spring Boot application. 
Specifically, we utilize OpenAI's RESTful endpoints and Spring AI to interact with the AI model. 
The Spring Boot application provides a RESTful API endpoint for seamless communication with the AI model. 
It's worth noting that Spring-AI is a relatively new framework and currently lacks a stable version.
However, we anticipate the release of a stable version in the future.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher
- Maven
- OpenAI Credentials
